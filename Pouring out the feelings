I love Shaib Halimat Adeshola is an understatement to describe the feelings i have for her..... I usually find my self gawking at her during lectures.... She has this gentle character which i find terrifying at times, cos i have always known people who are gentle to have some kind off fierce personality in them. Besides that she is an amazing person. actually, i dont know if she has any flaws but if she does, she is doing a good job covering them up. If Only i could be with her, perharps i'd just watch her every morning as she sleeps peace fully!!!
